# mtg_sim

## Purpose:

A Magic: The Gathering game simulator in Python. I created this simulator to be open-ended and allow the user to access as much of the game's internals as possible towards whatever purpose they might have.

## RoadMap:

Getting a simulator up and running.

## Progress:

Nothing yet!
